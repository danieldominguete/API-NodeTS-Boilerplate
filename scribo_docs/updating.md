# Updating Docs

![Updating Docs](/tutorial/updating.png)

Scribo uses Markdown files to store your documentation. This means that, if you are a developer, you probably already know the syntax. It is used by most of the git documentation.

But don't worry if you are not a developer. The syntax is really simple, and that are lots of good tutorials on the internet:

- [Markdown GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
- [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/getting-started-with-markdown)

## For Developers

If you are a developer, you can use all the tools that you are already familiar with, to update markdown files, and push the changes to GitHub. We recommend the following tools/plugins:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)


But you can use any IDE/Code editor of your preference.

## For Non-Developers

GitHub Platform offers an excellent file/markdown editor. If you wish, you can edit all your documentations inside GitHub, making it easy to update your Scribo Documentation Webpage.
