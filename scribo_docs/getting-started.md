# Getting Started

![Getting Started](/tutorial/getting-started.png)

To start using Scribo, you only need to complete five easy steps:

## Sign-in

First, you will need to create a new account at [https://scribo.dev/](https://scribo.dev/). You can choose to sign-in using one of the three methods:

- Google Account;
- Github Account;
- Twitter Account.

## Team Information

Fill up your team's information. The slug field is really important since it will be used as an alias to your documentation page. For example, a slug with the value `acme` will result in a `acme.scribo.dev` website.

## Clone Example Repository

Clone our template repository to start a new documentation page for your team. In the next sections, we will explain the project structure and all the rules. We designed it in a way that anybody could start a page with the minimum effort possible, but with a system powerful enough to offer many customizations.


## Public Repository

Copy the URL of the public repository you created and save it in our dashboard.

## Install our GitHub App

To keep your changes in sync with our platform, you will need to install our [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/scribo-robot). Every commit to this public repository will be synced with Scribo by this robot. Without is, changes in your docs will not propagate to Scribo.

## Make you first commit

To finish the process, make some changes to the README.md file and commit to GitHub. You can do this using the GitHub portal if you wish. This step is necessary to make sure our GitHub App has synchronized the newly created repository.

## That's It

You can now visit [https://SLUG.scribo.dev](https://SLUG.scribo.dev) and see your documentation website up and running. In the next sections, we will explore all the functionalities of the Scribo platform.
