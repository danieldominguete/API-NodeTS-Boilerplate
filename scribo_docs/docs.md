![<Markdown Rules>](/tutorial/markdown.png)

Scribo uses Markdown files to store your documentation. All functionallities should work as expect, but you should follow some instructions to take the most out of the platform.

## Images

All images should be placed in the `assets` folder. You can organize your files the way you like, the only restriction is to place them in this folder.

To reference an image on you document, just use the following syntax:

```
![<IMAGE ALT>](/<IMAGE.PNG>)
```

Notice that is not necessary to informe the `assets` folder in the path.

## Links

You can create hyperlinks to other documents the same way you would do with a normal Markdown. It is not necessary to explicit use the full path if is an internal document.

```
[<LINK ALT>](/<LINK>)
```
